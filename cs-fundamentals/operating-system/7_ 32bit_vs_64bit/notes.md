# 32-Bit vs 64-Bit OS

## 1. Basic Idea

The main difference between **32-bit** and **64-bit** systems is the size of their **registers** and the amount of **memory addresses** they can access.

### 32-bit OS

* Uses **32-bit registers**.
* Can access `2^32` unique memory addresses.
* `2^32 = 4 GB` of addressable physical memory.

### 64-bit OS

* Uses **64-bit registers**.
* Can access `2^64` unique memory addresses.
* This equals approximately **17,179,869,184 GB** of addressable physical memory.

# 2. What Does "32-bit" or "64-bit" Mean?

The number of bits tells us how much data the CPU architecture can process.

* **32-bit CPU** → can process **32 bits** of data/information.
* **64-bit CPU** → can process **64 bits** of data/information. 

### Easy way to remember

Think of the CPU's register as a **box** that holds data.

```text
32-bit → smaller box → 32 bits
64-bit → bigger box → 64 bits
```

A bigger register can work with larger amounts of data at once.

# 3. Advantages of 64-bit Over 32-bit

## A. Addressable Memory

This is the biggest advantage.

```text
32-bit CPU → 2^32 memory addresses
64-bit CPU → 2^64 memory addresses
```

So, a 64-bit system can address vastly more memory than a 32-bit system. 

### Simple example

Imagine memory is a huge apartment building.

* A **32-bit CPU** has a limited number of apartment numbers.
* A **64-bit CPU** has an enormous number of possible apartment numbers.

More possible addresses means the system can work with much more memory.

## B. Resource Usage

If you install a lot of RAM on a **32-bit OS**, simply adding more RAM does not provide the same benefit.

Upgrading such a system to a **64-bit version of Windows** can make a noticeable difference when using excess RAM. 

### Easy idea

```text
32-bit OS + lots of RAM
        ↓
Limited benefit

64-bit OS + lots of RAM
        ↓
Can make better use of the available resources
```

---

## C. Performance

Calculations are performed using **CPU registers**.

When a program performs a calculation:

```text
Memory
  ↓
Data loaded into registers
  ↓
Calculation happens
```

Larger registers allow the processor to work with larger amounts of data at the same time. 

According to the lecture:

```text
32-bit processor → 4 bytes in 1 instruction cycle
64-bit processor → 8 bytes in 1 instruction cycle
```

There can be thousands to billions of instruction cycles per second, depending on processor design. 

### Remember

```text
32-bit → 4 bytes
64-bit → 8 bytes
```

So, the 64-bit architecture can handle a larger amount of data in an instruction cycle.

---

## D. Compatibility

A **64-bit CPU** can run:

```text
32-bit OS
+
64-bit OS
```

But a **32-bit CPU** can run only:

```text
32-bit OS
```

So, 64-bit CPUs provide greater compatibility. 

---

## E. Better Graphics Performance

64-bit systems can perform **8-byte graphics calculations**, which can help graphics-intensive applications run faster. 

Examples of graphics-intensive applications include:

```text
Games
3D applications
Video/graphics software
```

### One-line memory trick

> **64-bit = bigger registers + much more addressable memory + better compatibility + improved performance potential.**

### What does RAM do?

RAM temporarily keeps the programs and data that the CPU needs right now.

For example, when you open Chrome:

```text
SSD
 ↓
Chrome program is loaded into RAM
 ↓
CPU needs some data (Chrome is a program. When Chrome is running, its code and the data it is currently using are loaded into RAM.)
 ↓
Data moves from RAM → Registers
 ↓
CPU processes it
```

So the roles are:

- RAM      = stores data/programs currently being used
- Register = stores the tiny amount of data CPU is working on right now
- CPU      = processes/calculates the data
