Yes. This example combines **static class fields**, **instance properties**, **static methods**, and how `sort()` uses a comparator. Let's break it down.

## 1. `static id = 1`

```js
class User {
    static id = 1;
```

The important word is **`static`**.

A static property belongs to the **class itself**, not to individual objects created from the class.

Think of it like:

```text
User
 └── id = 1
```

Not:

```text
user1 ── id
user2 ── id
user3 ── id
```

So you access it using:

```js
User.id
```

and **not**:

```js
user1.id
```

Initially:

```js
console.log(User.id); // 1
```

---

# 2. What happens when `new User()` runs?

Look at your constructor:

```js
constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.id = User.id++;
}
```

When you do:

```js
const user1 = new User('Rakesh K', 30);
```

JavaScript creates a new object:

```js
user1 = {
    name: "Rakesh K",
    age: 30,
    id: 1
}
```

Why is `id` 1?

Because:

```js
this.id = User.id++;
```

`User.id++` means:

1. Take the current value of `User.id`
2. Give that value to `this.id`
3. Then increase `User.id`

So:

```text
Before:
User.id = 1

user1 created:
user1.id = 1

After ++:
User.id = 2
```

Then:

```js
const user2 = new User('John Doe', 40);
```

gives:

```text
user2.id = 2
User.id = 3
```

Then:

```js
const user3 = new User('Jane Doe', 20);
```

gives:

```text
user3.id = 3
User.id = 4
```

So finally:

```js
console.log(User.id);
```

would be:

```text
4
```

Notice the difference:

```text
CLASS
User
 └── id = 4


INSTANCES
user1
 ├── name = Rakesh K
 ├── age = 30
 └── id = 1

user2
 ├── name = John Doe
 ├── age = 40
 └── id = 2

user3
 ├── name = Jane Doe
 ├── age = 20
 └── id = 3
```

This is the key idea behind `static`.

---

# 3. `compareByAge` is also static

You have:

```js
static compareByAge(user1, user2) {
    return user1.age - user2.age;
}
```

Again, `static` means this method belongs to the **class**.

So you call:

```js
User.compareByAge(...)
```

You don't call:

```js
user1.compareByAge(...)
```

because `compareByAge` isn't an instance method.

Think:

```text
User
 ├── id
 └── compareByAge()


user1
 ├── name
 ├── age
 └── id
```

---

# 4. Why make `compareByAge` static?

Because `compareByAge()` doesn't really belong to **one particular user**.

It compares **two users**:

```js
User.compareByAge(user1, user2)
```

It doesn't need:

```js
this.name
this.age
this.id
```

Instead, you explicitly give it the two users:

```js
compareByAge(user1, user2)
```

That's a good use case for a static method.

You can think of it as a **utility associated with the `User` class**.

---

# 5. Now the interesting part: `sort()`

You have:

```js
users.sort(User.compareByAge);
```

Your array is:

```js
[
    user1, // age 30
    user2, // age 40
    user3  // age 20
]
```

`sort()` needs to know:

> "When I compare two users, which one should come first?"

So you give it this function:

```js
User.compareByAge
```

Conceptually, `sort()` does things like:

```js
User.compareByAge(user1, user2)
```

which becomes:

```js
30 - 40
```

Result:

```text
-10
```

Then it may compare:

```js
User.compareByAge(user2, user3)
```

which becomes:

```js
40 - 20
```

Result:

```text
20
```

And so on.

---

# 6. Why does negative / positive / zero work?

This is the important part.

For:

```js
array.sort(compareFunction)
```

JavaScript interprets the comparator result roughly like this:

```text
negative  → first item comes before second
positive  → first item comes after second
zero      → keep them equivalent in ordering
```

So:

```js
user1.age - user2.age
```

For ages 30 and 40:

```js
30 - 40 = -10
```

Negative means:

```text
30-year-old should come before 40-year-old
```

For 40 and 20:

```js
40 - 20 = 20
```

Positive means:

```text
40-year-old should come after 20-year-old
```

For two users aged 30 and 30:

```js
30 - 30 = 0
```

They are equal for this sorting criterion.

So the final result is:

```text
20
30
40
```

Therefore:

```js
[
    user3,
    user1,
    user2
]
```

---

# 7. `sort()` doesn't care about `-10`, `20`, etc.

This is an important correction to your earlier question.

`sort()` doesn't care about the **actual number**.

For example:

```js
-10
-1
-500
```

All mean:

> first item should come before second.

And:

```js
10
1
500
```

all mean:

> first item should come after second.

And:

```js
0
```

means:

> they are equal according to this comparator.

So this would also work:

```js
static compareByAge(user1, user2) {
    if (user1.age < user2.age) {
        return -1;
    }

    if (user1.age > user2.age) {
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Your subtraction version:

```js
return user1.age - user2.age;
```

is simply a convenient shortcut.

---

# 8. Static methods can call other static methods

You commented:

> two static methods can call each other

Correct.

For example:

```js
class User {
    static method1() {
        User.method2();
    }

    static method2() {
        console.log("Hello");
    }
}
```

You can do:

```js
User.method1();
```

and `method1()` calls:

```js
User.method2();
```

Because both methods belong to the class.

Inside a static method, you commonly use:

```js
User.method2();
```

or:

```js
this.method2();
```

For example:

```js
static method1() {
    this.method2();
}
```

---

# 9. What about normal instance methods?

Suppose:

```js
class User {
    greet() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
}
```

`greet()` is **not static**.

It belongs to User instances.

So:

```js
const user1 = new User("Rakesh", 30);

user1.greet();
```

works.

But:

```js
User.greet();
```

doesn't work.

The relationship is:

```text
              User class
             /          \
       static stuff     prototype
       User.id          greet()
       User.method()


            ↓ new

         user1 object
       /      |       \
    name     age     id
                    +
             prototype → greet()
```

---

# 10. Why can't an instance method directly call a static method?

Be careful with this statement:

> "two static methods can call each other, can't possible by normal methods"

That's **not quite correct**.

Instance methods **can absolutely call static methods**. They just need to access the class.

For example:

```js
class User {
    static sayHello() {
        console.log("Hello");
    }

    greet() {
        User.sayHello();
    }
}
```

Then:

```js
const user1 = new User();

user1.greet();
```

works.

The distinction is about **where the method/property lives**.

```js
User.sayHello();    // static
user1.greet();      // instance
```

---

# 11. `Math.random()` is a good example

You wrote:

```js
Math.random()
```

Yes, this is conceptually similar.

You don't do:

```js
const math = new Math();
math.random();
```

Instead:

```js
Math.random();
```

`random()` is accessed from the `Math` object itself.

Similarly:

```js
User.compareByAge();
```

accesses a static method from the class.

---

# 12. `Object.hasOwn()` and `hasOwnProperty()` look almost identical**, but they are two different methods.

Let's ignore everything else and focus only on this.

### First: what is `Object`?

`Object` is a built-in JavaScript object/function.

You can call things directly on it:

```js
Object.keys(...)
Object.values(...)
Object.hasOwn(...)
```

These are **static methods**.

So:

```js
Object.hasOwn(user, "name")
```

means:

> "Ask the `Object` class/function whether `user` has its own `name` property."

---

### Now what is `hasOwnProperty()`?

Suppose:

```js
const user = {
    name: "Rakesh",
    age: 30
};
```

You can do:

```js
user.hasOwnProperty("name");
```

Here, you're calling the method **on `user`**.

So this is an **instance method**.

Think:

```text
Object
  └── hasOwn()          ← static method

user
  └── hasOwnProperty()  ← instance method
```

---

### Compare them directly

```js
Object.hasOwn(user, "name");
```

vs.

```js
user.hasOwnProperty("name");
```

Both answer approximately the same question:

> Does `user` itself have a property called `"name"`?

Both return:

```js
true
```

But they are accessed differently.

### Static

```js
Object.hasOwn(user, "name");
```

You access it through **`Object`**.

### Instance

```js
user.hasOwnProperty("name");
```

You access it through **`user`**.

---

### Why is `hasOwnProperty()` available on `user`?

This is where your previous learning about **prototypes** connects.

When you create:

```js
const user = {
    name: "Rakesh"
};
```

`user` has a prototype.

That prototype eventually provides:

```js
hasOwnProperty()
```

So:

```js
user.hasOwnProperty()
```

works because the method is available through the prototype chain.

---

### Very simple analogy

Imagine `Object` is a **toolbox**.

```text
Object
 ├── keys()
 ├── values()
 └── hasOwn()
```

You use the toolbox directly:

```js
Object.hasOwn(...)
```

But every object created through the normal object system gets access to certain methods through its prototype:

```text
user
  ↓
Object.prototype
  ├── hasOwnProperty()
  ├── toString()
  └── ...
```

So:

```js
user.hasOwnProperty(...)
```

---

### One correction to your original note

Instead of writing:

```text
Object.hasOwnProperty() is also a static method
```

write:

```text
Object.hasOwn() → static method

user.hasOwnProperty() → instance/prototype method
```

That's the important distinction.

---

## The whole example in one picture

```text
                    User CLASS
              ┌─────────────────────┐
              │ static id = 1       │
              │                     │
              │ static              │
              │ compareByAge()      │
              └──────────┬──────────┘
                         │
                    new User()
                         │
            ┌────────────┼────────────┐
            ↓            ↓            ↓
         user1         user2        user3
         age: 30       age: 40      age: 20
         id: 1         id: 2        id: 3
```

And:

```js
users.sort(User.compareByAge);
```

means essentially:

```text
Give sort() the User class's compareByAge function.

sort()
  ↓
compare two users
  ↓
user1.age - user2.age
  ↓
negative / positive / zero
  ↓
decide their ordering
```

### The 3 things to remember

**1. `static` → belongs to the class**

```js
User.id
User.compareByAge()
```

**2. `this` inside the constructor → belongs to the newly created object**

```js
this.name
this.age
this.id
```

**3. `sort()` comparator**

```js
return negative;  // first before second
return positive;  // first after second
return 0;         // equal
```

That is the core of this entire example.
