# Storage Devices Basics

This note is about the **different types of memory/storage present in a computer** and how they differ in **cost, speed, size, and volatility**.

# 1. Different Types of Memory

The lecture divides computer memory into:

```text
Primary Memory
│
├── Register
├── Cache
└── Main Memory (RAM)

Secondary Memory
│
├── Electronic Disk
├── Magnetic Disk
├── Optical Disk
└── Magnetic Tapes
```

This diagram shows this hierarchy from **Register at the top** to **Magnetic Tapes at the bottom**.

# 2. Register

A **register** is the **smallest unit of storage** and is actually a part of the **CPU itself**. 

It can temporarily hold:

* An instruction
* A memory/storage address
* Data such as bits or characters

### Why is it needed?

The CPU uses registers for data and instructions that it is **working with immediately**.

```text
CPU
 │
 └── Registers
       ↓
   Data being
 processed now
```

### Easy analogy

```text
Your entire room = Secondary storage
Your study table = RAM
Your notebook open in front of you = Cache
The information currently in your hand = Register
```

So:

> **Register = CPU's immediate working storage.**

---

# 3. Cache

**Cache** is an additional memory that temporarily stores **frequently used instructions and data** so the CPU can access them more quickly.

Software can also use something called a cache, but it is different from the hardware cache.

Imagine you repeatedly need the same book.

Instead of going to the bookshelf every time:

```text
Bookshelf → Study table
```

you keep the frequently used book right beside you:

```text
Frequently used data
        ↓
      Cache
        ↓
       CPU
```

### Easy definition

> **Cache = fast temporary memory that keeps frequently used data/instructions close to the CPU.**

---

# 4. Main Memory

> **Main Memory = RAM** 

RAM stores programs and data that are currently being used by the computer.

For example:

```text
You open Chrome
      ↓
Chrome is loaded into RAM
      ↓
CPU works with the required data
```

So:

```text
Register → Immediate CPU work
Cache    → Frequently used data
RAM      → Currently running programs/data
```

---

# 5. Secondary Memory

Secondary memory refers to **storage media where the computer stores data and programs**. 

Examples given in the lecture's diagram include:

```text
Electronic Disk
Magnetic Disk
Optical Disk
Magnetic Tapes
```

In simple terms, this is where data can be stored for longer-term use.

For example:

```text
SSD/HDD
    ↓
Your files, videos, programs, documents
```

---

# 6. Primary vs Secondary Memory

## A. Cost

```text
Primary storage → Expensive
Secondary storage → Cheaper
```

Registers are the **most expensive** among these because of the expensive semiconductor technology and labor involved. 

### Remember

```text
Register → Very expensive
Secondary storage → Cheaper
```

---

# 7. Access Speed

This is very important.

The lecture says:

```text
Primary memory > Secondary memory
```

meaning primary memory has higher access speed.

Within primary memory:

```text
Register
   ↓
 Cache
   ↓
Main Memory (RAM)
```

So the order from **fastest to slower** is:

> **Register → Cache → RAM → Secondary Memory** 

### Easy trick

The closer the memory is to the CPU, the faster it generally is.

```text
CPU
 ↓
Register     ⚡ Fastest
 ↓
Cache        ⚡
 ↓
RAM          ⚡
 ↓
Secondary    🐢 Slower
```

---

# 8. Storage Size

Secondary storage has **more space** than primary storage. 

For example:

```text
Register → Tiny
Cache → Small
RAM → Larger
SSD/HDD → Much larger
```

So:

> **More storage space usually comes with slower access.**

---

# 9. Volatility

**Volatile memory** means the data is lost when power is turned off.

The lecture states:

```text
Primary memory → Volatile
Secondary memory → Non-volatile
```



### Example

Suppose you are editing a document.

Before saving:

```text
RAM
 ↓
Data exists temporarily
```

Power goes off:

```text
RAM → Data lost
```

But data saved on secondary storage remains:

```text
SSD/HDD
 ↓
Data remains after power off
```

So:

```text
Volatile     = loses data when power is OFF
Non-volatile = keeps data when power is OFF
```

---

# 10. Complete Memory Hierarchy

This is the most important part to remember:

```text
                CPU
                 ↓
              Register
                 ↓
               Cache
                 ↓
              RAM
                 ↓
        Secondary Storage
```

As we go **down**:

```text
Speed       ↓
Cost        ↓
Storage     ↑
```

And:

```text
Primary Memory → Volatile
Secondary Memory → Non-volatile
```

# 11. Quick Comparison

| Feature      | Register           | Cache                | RAM                   | Secondary Storage |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Location     | Inside CPU         | Close to CPU         | Main memory           | Storage device    |
| Speed        | Fastest            | Very fast            | Fast                  | Slower            |
| Size         | Smallest           | Small                | Larger                | Largest           |
| Main purpose | Immediate CPU work | Frequently used data | Running programs/data | Long-term storage |
| Volatile?    | Primary            | Primary              | Primary               | Non-volatile      |

The lecture specifically establishes the relative speed, size, cost, and volatility relationships above.

# 12. Connect This With Your Previous Lecture

Your previous question about **register vs RAM** fits directly into this lecture.

When Chrome is running:

```text
SSD
 ↓
Chrome is loaded into RAM
 ↓
Frequently used Chrome data may be kept in cache
 ↓
The CPU takes the immediate data/instructions
 ↓
Registers hold what the CPU is actively working on
```

So you can think of it as:

```text
SSD/HDD = Store everything
RAM     = Keep currently running things
Cache   = Keep frequently needed things
Register = Keep what CPU needs RIGHT NOW
```
